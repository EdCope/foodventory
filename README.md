# PantryPal

PantryPal is an app that allows users to add the contents of their kitchen and find recipes based on those contents. It can allow users to add their own recipes as well as browse some from the internet, and can convert between imperial and metric measurements. It alerts you when you're missing ingredients for a specific recipe

## MVP

For our MVP, we would like our app to acheive the following user stories:

```
As a user,
So I can visit the site, 
It should have a home page.  
```

```
As a user,
So I can add the contents of my fridge,
It should be able to add ingredients.
```

```
As a user,
So I can see the contents of my fridge,
It should be able to list all ingredients.
```

```
As a user,
So that I know what I have used,
I would like to be able to delete an ingredient.
```

```
As a user,
So that I can have an accurate description of what's in my pantry,
I would to avoid duplications.
```

```
As a user,
So that I can access my account,
I would like to be able to sign in.
```

```
As a user,
So that my account stays secure,
I'd like to be able to log out when I'm done.
```
